"Adoption" tab will take you to the list of pets available for adoption. The data was web scrapped from real life shelter websites, so all animals on display are available for adoption and links in info-cards will take you to the corresponding shelter websites. The filter section containing amongst others 'age', 'species' and search by name, will speedup the search for the perfect companion.
